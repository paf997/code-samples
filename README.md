This repository has a number of code samples form my most recent classes, Cmpt 306 (Game Mechanics) and Cmpt 317 ( Introduction to AI), Comp 350 (Web Development) and Cmpt 370 (Intermediate Software engineering). It also has some code samples from Cmpt 280 ( Data structures and algorithms) from my second year at the U of S.
